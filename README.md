# 🌱 EcoNav AI — Exposure Credit Platform

EcoNav AI is an **intelligent routing platform** and Reinforcement Learning (RL) environment built for the **Meta AI Environmental Decision Intelligence Hackathon**. It empowers users and agents to navigate urban networks while minimizing pollution exposure and maximizing health "Exposure Credits."

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

EcoNav AI transforms navigation from a simple distance-minimization problem into a **multi-objective environmental optimization task**. By integrating real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data with dynamic traffic simulations, the platform provides a realistic testing ground for eco-aware agents.

### Key Innovations:
- **Live AQI Integration**: Real-time pollution data fetched from the Open-Meteo API for 50+ network nodes across India.
- **Exposure Credits**: A gamified health currency that penalizes high-pollution segments (Grade F) and rewards clean-air segments (Grade A).
- **Dynamic Traffic Engine**: Simulates congestion levels that impact both travel time and localized pollution exposure.
- **OpenEnv Compliance**: Fully compatible with the OpenEnv specification for RL evaluation and agent deployment.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

The project is architected as a modern **monorepo** for seamless development and deployment.

- **Backend**: Python 3.10+, FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, Torch (ML scoring).
- **Frontend**: Vite, Vanilla JS, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), Leaflet.js (Mapping), Chart.js (Analytics).
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Turbo (Build system), GitHub Actions (CI/CD).
- **Quality**: Ruff (Linting), Prettier (Formatting).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: >= 18.0.0
- **Python**: >= 3.10
- **npm**: >= 11.11.0

### Quick Start (Recommended)
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hitendras510/EcoNav-AI.git
   cd EcoNav-AI
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install                               # Installs monorepo build tools
   pip install -r requirements/backend.txt   # Installs Python backend deps
   ```

3. **Run Dev Environment**:
   Use the Turbo-powered development command to start both the backend and frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Manual Startup
- **Backend**: `python server/app.py` (Runs on [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860))
- **Frontend**: `npm run dev --prefix apps/frontend` (Runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173))

## 🧠 RL Evaluation (OpenEnv Compliance)

The environment supports four standard evaluation tasks of increasing complexity:
1. `easy_route`: Delhi to Kolkata (15 steps).
2. `medium_route`: Delhi to Kolkata (8 steps).
3. `hard_pollution_dodge`: Agra to Kolkata (6 steps).
4. `expert_credit_max`: Maximize credits while reaching the goal (10 steps).

**Running Baseline Evaluation**:
The `inference.py` script is optimized for OpenEnv compliance, featuring structured logging (`[START]`, `[STEP]`, `[END]`) and LLM agent support.

```bash
export ENV_URL="http://localhost:7860"
export HF_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token"
python inference.py
```

## 🧪 Development & Quality

We maintain high code quality standards through automated linting and formatting.

- **Linting (Python)**: `ruff check .`
- **Fix Linting**: `ruff check --fix .`
- **Formatting (JS/TS/MD)**: `npm run format`
